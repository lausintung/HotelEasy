# MiniProject
This is a hotel-room booking website.The website allows users to specify his/her requirements to the rooms such as the price range,the type of room and the number of guests. Then, the website displays the available rooms according to the user's requirement. The user may create an account to finish his/her booking with the website while the booking deatils and account information are stored to the database. The database stores the booking details of customers, the room deatils and the account information of customers. The user may modify his/her booking or leave comments on the services by signing in to his/her account. 

*** After uploading the files to the webhost, some of the functions (e.g create account, signin) that trigger a modal box cannot be displayed normally. You may try to use mobile or ie to check out the function. For the hotel search box, it works best at chrome.***
